Back when starting in my first software development job I thought my success at work would be directly determined by my programming skills. Of course, that's not the case. One can be the most productive and clever programmer in the world, but in my opinion, that alone isn't sufficient for a satisfactory career in software development.

So while keeping up with the latest advances in software development is important, I think it's just as important to keep learning other aspects of a software developers' working day. Sometimes such skills like getting along with your colleagues are called "soft skills" (a term I find a bit patronizing). What's a better way of learning than reading books? Here are three of my favorite non-programming books I think developers could enjoy.


<!-- 
 For some time now I've started workdays by reading a book. The book of the day could be directly related to the day's work, but most often it is not. I think reading books not directly related to the day's work is a good way to gain fresh perspectives and get inspired to try new ideas.

In this article, I'd like to share some of my favorite non-programming books.  -->

### [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) by Dale Carnegie

[Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie) said "Dealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face." I think this applies to software development as well. Every day you're dealing with other people and their needs, be it customers, clients, team mates, or your boss.

The best book I've read on inteacting with people is Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People* from 1936. The title of the book may lead you believe this book is about manipulating people to like you or have them do what you want. That's not the case at all: In contrary, Carnegie repeatedly shows how sincerity and empathy are the keys to satisfactory relationships with people. All in all, they are the keys to a more satisfactory career and life.

"Don't condemn, judge or complain", "talk about others' interests", "if you're wrong, admit it immediately", "let others save face", "consider others' needs before you speak", "never say anyone they're wrong". These are some of the advice Carnegie teaches, be it talking to your boss, team mate or potential customer. It may feel hard to deal with people in a professional setting with such hard constraints, but I think Dale Carnegie makes compelling statements how it's possible and why it pays off.

Soft skills are patronized. -->

<!-- One of the advice in the book is to never tell anyone they're wrong. That sounds like a big deal in an environment like software development. But after reading the chapter, I agree: there are better ways to handle situations than telling people they're wrong. It pays off to handle conflicts carefully: after all, it might turn out to be you who's wrong. -->

Here's a tongue-in-cheek stereotype description of programmers from *The Clean Coder* by Robert C. Martin:

> "Programmers tend to be arrogant, self-absorbed introverts. We didn't get into this business because we like *people*. Most of us got into programming because we prefer to deeply focus on sterile minutia, juggle lots of concepts simultaneously, and in general prove to ourselves that we have brains the size of a planet, all while not having to interact with the messy complexities of other people."

It's a stereotype, but there's a hint of truth in there. And just because such stereotypes exist, we developers should spend extra effort on learning how to collaborate and get along with people.

### [The Lean Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup) by Eric Ries

- How to know what to work on next
- How to minimize waste
- How to be accountable by measuring

### [The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder) by Robert C. Martin

Robert C. Martin is somewhat controversial figure, and some may find his writing style a bit arrogant. Putting that aside, I think The Clean Coder is a very good read for anyone serious about a career in software development. The book explains very well how to take responsibility, how to commit without saying "I'll try" and how to say no when your boss tells you to deliver a release by Friday when it's impossible.

- How to say no and keep up to your standards
- How to commit professionally without saying "Let's see", "I'll try", etc.
- How to deal with writer's block
