### [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People) by Dale Carnegie

Don't be put off by the title of this book from 1930s. It is *not* about becoming the most popular person in the party or about how to manipulate people to have them do what you want. It's about getting along with people, and that's one of the most important skills any software developer needs.

> "Dealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face."

> "You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you."

> Don't condemn or complain; talk about others' interests; if you're wrong, admit it immediately; let others save face; consider others' needs before you speak; never say anyone they're wrong.

It may feel hard to deal with people with such constraints, but Dale Carnegie makes compelling statements how it's possible and why it pays off.

Soft skills are patronized.

One of the advice in the book is to never tell anyone they're wrong. That sounds like a big deal in an environment like software development. But after reading the chapter, I agree: there are better ways to handle situations than telling people they're wrong. It pays off to handle conflicts carefully: after all, it might turn out to be you who's wrong.

Here's a tongue-in-cheek stereotype description from The Clean Coder:

> "Programmers tend to be arrogant, self-absorbed introverts. We didn't get into this business because we like *people*. Most of us got into programming because we prefer to deeply focus on sterile minutia, juggle lots of concepts simultaneously, and in general prove to ourselves that we have brains the size of a planet, all while not having to interact with the messy complexities of other people."

It's a stereotype, but there's a hint of truth in there.

### [The Lean Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup) by Eric Ries

- How to know what to work on next
- How to minimize waste
- How to be accountable by measuring

### [The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder) by Robert C. Martin

Robert C. Martin is somewhat controversial figure, and some may find his writing style a bit arrogant. Putting that aside, I think The Clean Coder is a very good read for anyone serious about a career in software development. The book explains very well how to take responsibility, how to commit without saying "I'll try" and how to say no when your boss tells you to deliver a release by Friday when it's impossible.

- How to say no and keep up to your standards
- How to commit professionally without saying "Let's see", "I'll try", etc.
- How to deal with writer's block
