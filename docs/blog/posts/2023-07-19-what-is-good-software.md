# What is good software?

During the last three years, I've had the opportunity to conduct 70 technical interviews. In all these interviews, I've asked candidates the same question: "_What is good software?_" In this post, I'd like to share common answers to this question.

<!-- more -->

In my experience, the answer to the question "_What is good software?_" tells something about the seniority level of the candidate. While there is no right or wrong answer to the question, I've found that senior developers tend to approch the question at higher level than more junior developers.

Martin Fowler [divides](https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html) software quality attributes into external and internal attributes. The distinction is that users of the software can directly see external quality but have no direct visibility to internal quality. Below, I will group the categories into these two categories.

## External quality

### Good software creates value

In general, the purpose of software is to create value to its users and the business. If the software does not create value to users or the business, it is bad software.

How can software fail to create value to its users? Most typically, the software fails to solve any real problem or meet the needs of its users. Following a development process such as Lean UX can reduce the probability of building something that no-one wants, but understanding what users really need is super hard.

It could be argued that value creation is not a software issue but a product issue. This is perhaps true. I have work experience only from relatively small companies, where every software developer is essentially a product developer as well and the distinction between software and product does not really matter. Every software developer makes product decisions every day.

### Good software meets requirements

### Good software has good user experience

## Internal quality

### Easy to change

### Easy to maintain

### Tested

### Clean code

### Documentation
