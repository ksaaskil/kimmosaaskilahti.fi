# My values

"You have good values." This is one of the nicest things anyone could say to me. Values tell who we are and what we think is important. If my coworkers can see my values in how I behave, I think I have succeeded in my working career.

In this post, I'd like to briefly explain the values that drive me forward in my career. Jobs, roles and projects may change, but values remain.

## Know yourself

I want to get to know myself better every day. I want to understand what makes me happy and what makes me feel worse. By knowing myself I am more likely to live a happy life and do things that I enjoy.

People with healthy self-esteem are more likely to form healthy teams. Bad self-esteem makes it easy for ego to take over and start protecting us from criticism and humiliation. Too large ego can make healthy teamwork impossible. I want to get better at keeping my ego in bay.

I know have a lot to learn from my colleagues. Knowing and accepting myself as I am makes it possible for me to be humble and open to new ideas. Being vulnerable is a strength.

## Lead by example

I want to lead by example. I believe I have a lot to give to my working community no matter where I work. I have put a lot of effort to become better as a person and to do my job better. I want to do actions that promote a culture of quality, respect, trust and transparency.

Leadership is not the same as being a manager. Everyone can be a leader irrespective of their role. For example, a colleague with a positive and enthusiastic attitude can be a leader.

## Keep learning

I love learning. I love reading books and watching presentations. I love learning from my colleagues by, for example, reading their code and getting their feedback on my code.

I enjoy being a teacher and sharing my knowledge. Teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn and get better at any subject. By learning and expanding my skills, I have also new things to teach and share.
