# Looking back on my career so far

I'm starting a new job next week. This seems like a good opportunity to look back on my career as software engineer. What did I expect from the different jobs and positions and what happened?

## University

I worked as a doctoral researcher in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Computational Science at Aalto University 2011-2015.

**What I expected**

I expected to fulfill my dream of getting a doctoral degree. I wanted to also get skills in computational science that would make it easy for me to transition to a career in IT in private sector.

**What happened**

I got my doctorate and had a great time doing so. My supervisor Jani taught me much of what I know about research and scientific writing. I made a good friend in the research team.

I spent six months as a visiting researcher in Ecole Centrale Paris. Living in Paris was an experience I will not forget and and I got to know amazing people. During my visit, I was very lucky to work on a topic that would lead to the computational method that defined my whole thesis. The papers created together with the Paris team are my highest cited articles to date and I'm very proud of all of them for the rest of my life.

During my doctoral studies, I was very opportunistic to pick courses that would promote my transition to private sector after my doctorate. I took courses in C programming, machine learning, Bayesian inference, and data structures and algorithms. These courses were useless for my thesis, but they were essential in preparing for the move to private sector for a career in IT.

I got to know two great researchers in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Computational Science. This connection eventually lead me to successfully apply for a position in IndoorAtlas, the company to which I moved after my doctorate.
