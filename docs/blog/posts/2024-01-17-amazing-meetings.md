# How to run amazing meetings

> This post is a summary of Chapter 6, "Amazing Meetings", from [_The Making of a Manager_](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/manager.html) by Julie Zhuo.

Good meetings are simple and straightforward. Practice clarity and ruthless efficiency with your meetings, and people will thank you for respecting the sanctity of their time.

<!-- more -->

You leave good meetings feeling the same way every time:

- The meeting was a great use of my time.
- I learned something new that will help me be more effective at my job.
- I left with a clearer sense of what I should do next.
- Everyone was engaged.
- I felt welcomed.

Think beforehand: _What does a great outcome look like for this meeting?_

Meeting should generally have only one purpose. There are five different purposes a meeting can have.

**Making a decision**

A great decision-making meeting does the following:

- Gets a decision made
- Includes the people most directly affected by the decision as a clearly designated decision-maker
- Presents all credible options objectively and with relevant background information, and includes the team's recommendation if there is one
- Gives equal airtime to dissenting opinions and makes people feel that they were heard

**Sharing information**

A great informational meeting achieves the following:

- Enables the group to feel like they learned something valuable
- Conveys key messages clearly and memorably
- Keeps the audience's attention (through dynamic speakers, rich storytelling, skilled pacing, interactivity)
- Evokes an intended emotion â€“ whether inspiration, trust, pride, courage, empathy, etc.

**Providing feedback**

A great feedback meeting achieves the following:

- Gets everyone on the same page about success for the project looks like
- Honestly represents the current status of the work, including an assessment of how things are going, any changes since the last check-in, and what the future plans are
- Clearly frames open questions, key decisions, or known concerns to get the most helpful feedback
- Ends with agreed-upon next steps, including when the next milestone or check-in will be

**Generating ideas**

A great generative meeting does the following:

- Produces many diverse, nonobvious solutions through ensuring each participant has quiet alone time to think of ideas and write them down (either before or during the meeting)
- Considers the totality of ideas from everyone, not just the loudest voices
- Helps ideas evolve and build off each other through meaningful discussion
- Ends with clear next steps for how to turn ideas into action

**Strengthening relationships**

A great team-bonding meeting enables the following:

- Creates better understanding and trust between participants
- Encourages people to be open and authentic
- Makes people feel cared for

Every meeting should be clear on which of the above it's trying to accomplish. Don't try to make a single meeting do too much, and remind the group of its primary purpose when the conversation starts to deviate. Decision meeting is not a good place for generating ideas.
