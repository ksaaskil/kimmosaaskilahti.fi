# How to nurture good team culture

> This post is a summary of Chapter 10, "Nurturing culture", from [_The Making of a Manager_](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/manager.html) by Julie Zhuo.

Culture describes the norms and values that govern how things are done. Managing a team is not only about creating the best one-on-one relationships with your reports, but also about their relationships with the other and with the group as whole. Your actions reinforce the company values. Establish the kind of culture you're proud of.

Culture exists whether or not you think about it. If the vibe feels hostile instead of helpful, it takes a long time to get things done, or maybe there's constant drama â€“ examine why this might be and what you can do about it.

To start improving on the culture, you need to figure out your team's strengths, growth areas and aspirations. Find the intersection between what your team does well and what you hope the team values.

## Understand your current team

To understand the current situation, think of the answers to the following questions:

- What are the first three adjectives that come to mind when describing the personality of your team?
- What moments made you feel most proud to be a part of your team? Why?
- What does your team do better than the majority of other teams out there?
- If you picked five random members of your team and individually asked each person, "What does your team value?" what would you hear?
- How similar is your team's culture to the broader organization's culture?
- Imagine a journalist scrutinizing your team. What would she say your team does well and not well?
- When people complain about how things work, whare are the top three things that they bring up?
