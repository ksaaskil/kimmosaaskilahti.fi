# The Power of Small Pull Requests

I have been working in professional software development for ten years. During these years, I have learned that the single most important development principle is to create small pull requests. This post explains why.

I recently came across a blog post named [_My programming beliefs as of July 2024_](https://evanhahn.com/programming-beliefs-as-of-july-2024/) by [Evan Hahn](https://evanhahn.com/). I very much liked the post and I can agree with most of the beliefs mentioned therein: focusing on testability, making invalid states unrepresentable and that simple opinions tend to be wrong, for example.

If I had to pick one programming belief that I believe in, it would be that _most good things in software development stem from small pull requests_.

[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are a mechanism in version control providers such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) to propose changes to a codebase and integrate those changes to together, as explained in this definition from GitHub:

> _A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase. Pull requests display the differences, or diffs, between the content in the source branch and the content in the target branch._
