_The Making of a Manager_ by Julie Zhuo is my favorite book on management and teamwork. The book starts from the basics and explains what management is about: getting better outcomes from a group of people working together. It then goes on to describe the first three months as a manager, how to lead a small team, how to run amazing meetings, etc. One of my favorite chapters explains how to manage yourself to become a better person, employee and colleague.

The advice in this book is useful for everyone who wants to improve the relationship with their manager and to learn to work better as a member of a team. I highly recommend the book for everyone.
