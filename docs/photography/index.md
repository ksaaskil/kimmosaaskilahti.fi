# Photography

I photograph things in nature with a Canon EOS 750D camera. For wildlife photography, I mostly use Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS II USM lens.

I postprocess photos using Adobe Lightroom Classic and Adobe Photoshop. I use Nik Collection for special effects such as detail extraction and cross processing.
