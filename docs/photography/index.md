# Photography

I photograph things in nature with a Canon EOS 750D camera. For wildlife photography, I mostly use Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS II USM lens.

I postprocess photos using Adobe Lightroom Classic and Adobe Photoshop. I use Nik Collection for special effects such as detail extraction and cross processing.

Wigeons are among the most beautiful waterfowl species. Their small, round head gives them a very elegant look. Especially the females and the young have beautiful feather ornaments in their back.

### European Hare

One of the best things about living where I live in East Helsinki is that there is a lot of wildlife. There are woodpeckers, hawks, geese, tits, foxes, stoats... But perhaps most importantly, there are two kinds of bunnies: European hares and European rabbits. Seeing bunnies brings a lot of joy in my everyday life.
