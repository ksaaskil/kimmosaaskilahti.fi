According to the free [VIA survey](https://www.viacharacter.org/), my top-5 personal strengths are:

**Love of Learning**

_Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one's own or formally; related to the
strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe the tendency to add systematically to what one knows._

**Judgment**

_Thinking things through and examining them from all sides; not jumping to conclusions; being able to change
one's mind in light of evidence; weighing all evidence fairly._

**Leadership**

_Encouraging a group of which one is a member to get things done and at the same time maintain good relations
within the group; organizing group activities and seeing that they happen._

**Prudence**

_Being careful about one's choices; not taking undue risks; not saying or doing things that might later be
regretted._

**Forgiveness**

_Forgiving those who have done wrong; accepting othersâ€™ shortcomings; giving people a second chance; not
being vengeful._
